                <p>
                    These ideas are nightmares to white parents
                    <br>
                    Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
                    <br>
                    Like whatever they say has no bearin' <br>
                    It's so scary in a house that allows no swearin'
                    <br>
                    To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
                    <br>
                    Alone in his own zone, cold, and he don't care
                    <br>
                    He's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
                    <br>
                    When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (bitch)
                    <br>
                    Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
                    <br>
                    If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
                    <br>
                    His thoughts are wacked, he's mad, so he's talkin' back
                    <br>
                    Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
                    <br>
                    He sags his pants, durags and a stockin' cap
                    <br>
                    His stepfather hit him, so he socked him back
                    <br>
                    And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
                    <br>
                    There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

                    (Come on)
                    Sing with me (sing), sing for the year (sing it) 
                    <br>
                    Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (come on) 
                    <br>
                    Sing it with me, it's just for today 
                    <br>
                    Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away</p>
